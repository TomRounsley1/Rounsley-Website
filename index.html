                <h2>Hi, I'm Tom 👋</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Loughborough University in 2023 with a first class Aeronautical Engineering Masters. After graduating, I worked as a mechanical design engineer on aero gas turbine test rigs. I left this role in 2024 to join RWE Offshore Wind as a renewables graduate. During this graduate scheme I performed roles as a Project Manager in the Innovation team, Bid Manager in the UK & Ireland development market, and seconded to RWE's onshore renewable buisness (OPEA) in a data and modelling role.

                I have decided to build this website as a platform from which to continue the development of my digital skills whilst doubling as a novel online CV, hopefully someday it can also be used to showcase the projects I have built.
                </p>

                    I am currently working to bring additional features and information to this site. As one of a fair few hobbies, it is a battle finding the time to work on it.
